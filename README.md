# Neural Network Overview

This project provides an overview of neural networks, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Neural Network

A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected artificial neurons that can recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform various tasks.

## TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a powerful and flexible machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows users to build and train neural networks using a dataflow graph. TensorFlow is highly optimized for distributed computing and is known for its scalability, making it suitable for large-scale projects.

## Keras

Keras is a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow and other machine learning frameworks. It provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for building and training neural networks. Keras is widely known for its ease of use, flexibility, and portability across different platforms.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a deep learning framework developed by Facebook. It offers a dynamic computational graph, which allows for more flexibility in model construction and training. PyTorch provides excellent support for tensor computation, has a clean and pythonic syntax, and is favored by researchers and data scientists who prefer a more dynamic and intuitive approach to building and experimenting with neural networks.

## project1 :-MNIST Number Identification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset for number identification.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model used in this project is a simple feedforward neural network with fully connected layers. The architecture consists of an input layer with 784 neurons (28x28 pixels flattened), a hidden layer with a configurable number of neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons corresponding to the 10 possible digit classes (0 to 9).

#### Loss and Cost Functions

Loss and cost functions are essential components of deep learning models that quantify the error or discrepancy between the predicted output and the target output. They guide the learning process by providing optimization objectives to minimize the error during training.
