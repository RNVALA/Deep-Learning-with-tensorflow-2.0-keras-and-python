# Neural Network Overview

This project provides an overview of neural networks, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Neural Network

A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected artificial neurons that can recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform various tasks.

## TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a powerful and flexible machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows users to build and train neural networks using a dataflow graph. TensorFlow is highly optimized for distributed computing and is known for its scalability, making it suitable for large-scale projects.

## Keras

Keras is a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow and other machine learning frameworks. It provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for building and training neural networks. Keras is widely known for its ease of use, flexibility, and portability across different platforms.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a deep learning framework developed by Facebook. It offers a dynamic computational graph, which allows for more flexibility in model construction and training. PyTorch provides excellent support for tensor computation, has a clean and pythonic syntax, and is favored by researchers and data scientists who prefer a more dynamic and intuitive approach to building and experimenting with neural networks.

## project1 :-MNIST Number Identification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset for number identification.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model used in this project is a simple feedforward neural network with fully connected layers. The architecture consists of an input layer with 784 neurons (28x28 pixels flattened), a hidden layer with a configurable number of neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons corresponding to the 10 possible digit classes (0 to 9).
